Musical Vehemence

Our app is basically a music player,but with an additional feature.
The basic version of the application is an interface where the user can select a song,play and pause it,forward it etc.The additional feature is that the user can play songs according to his mood. The app recognises his mood by taking a picture of him. On recognising the current state of his mind, which we believe is very much evident on his face, the application plays a song accordingly. Each emotion has a set of songs under it. Conversely, each song is attributed to a particular facial expression.The choice of which category the song belongs to is chosen by the user when he adds the song to his phone.

Therefore, the application will include a screen where the user gets to select a song manually. This screen also contains a button that on being clicked, redirects the user to the camera application where the user can capture his picture. Once heâ€™s done, the application processes the picture,recognises his expression,extracts the particular song from the database and plays it.
We believe that on completion, we will have before us an exciting app with a beautiful user-interface and wonderful features.
